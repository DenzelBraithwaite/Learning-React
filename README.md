# Learning-React- Learning React with Udemy
After graduating from the Le Wagon Full Stack Web development bootcamp, a few students and I purchased the Udemy React course, offered by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.
We study together on Saturdays and certain week days to motivate each other and continue learning modern web development.
After a section (or a study session) I push what we've worked on so far.
